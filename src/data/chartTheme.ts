/**
 * src/data/chartTheme.ts
 *
 * ★ THE DATA-VIZ DESIGN SYSTEM ★
 *
 * This is to charts what `plugins/vuetify.ts` is to components: the ONE place a
 * designer changes how every chart in the app looks. A chart never
 * hardcodes a color, font size, or mark dimension — it reads them from here (via
 * the `useChartTheme` composable). Change a value in this file and every chart
 * updates at once.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE FILE INSTEAD OF THE VUETIFY THEME
 *   The Vuetify theme has no concept of "series 4" or "a light→dark magnitude
 *   ramp" — those are genuinely new dimensions that charts need and components
 *   don't. So the *series* colors (categorical / sequential / diverging) live
 *   here. Everything a chart shares with the rest of the app — status colors,
 *   text ink, surfaces, gridlines — is NOT duplicated here; the composable pulls
 *   those live from the Vuetify theme so charts stay in lockstep with the app in
 *   both light and dark. This file owns only what's viz-specific.
 *
 * WHY THESE EXACT HEXES (don't retune by eye)
 *   Every palette below was validated against the real app surfaces —
 *   #FFFFFF (light card) and #0B1E33 (dark card). The checks: lightness band,
 *   chroma floor, colorblind (CVD) adjacent-pair separation, normal-vision
 *   separation, and contrast vs surface. The categorical ORDER is load-bearing:
 *   adjacent pairs were sequenced so no two neighbors collide under deuteranopia
 *   /protanopia/tritanopia.
 *
 *   ⚠️ NO VALIDATOR SCRIPT SHIPS IN THIS REPO. If you add or reorder a color,
 *   re-validate before shipping — load the `dataviz` skill, which carries the
 *   method and a runnable checker. Do not eyeball it.
 *
 * THE NON-NEGOTIABLES (from the data-viz method)
 *   • Categorical hues are assigned in fixed order, never cycled. A 7th series
 *     folds into "Other" / small multiples — it is never a generated hue.
 *   • Sequential = one hue, light→dark. Diverging = two hues + neutral gray mid.
 *   • Status colors (success/warning/error) are RESERVED for state meaning and
 *     are never reused as a series color — they always ship with an icon+label.
 *   • Text (labels, values, legends) wears text tokens, never the series color.
