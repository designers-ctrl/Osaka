 *
 * ★ BRAND PRESET — the answers to the /new-project intake quiz ★
 *
 * This is the single, inspectable record of a project's brand identity: its
 * name, description, the colors it chose (drawn from the DS palette), and its
 * radius personality. A new designer never has to hunt through config files —
 * they run the `/new-project` skill, answer a short quiz, and this file is
 * (re)written from their answers.
 *
 * TWO KINDS OF FIELD, TWO BEHAVIORS — read this before editing by hand:
 *
 *   • `identity` is LIVE. Screens import it (e.g. the header reads
 *     `brand.identity.name`), so editing it here changes the app immediately —
 *     it is the real source of truth for the product's name/description/copy.
 *     This is the dataset-driven pattern (see CLAUDE.md): a screen is a pure
 *     view over data, so a rename is one edit here, not a find-and-replace.
 *
 *   • `colors`, `radius` and `typography` are a RECORD of what was chosen. The
 *     values that actually style the app live in the design control panel:
 *         colors  → src/plugins/vuetify.ts   (theme.themes.light/dark.colors)
 *         radius  → src/styles/_tokens.scss   (the five $radius-* values; they
 *                                              feed BOTH the $rounded scale and
 *                                              $border-radius-root)
 *         font    → src/styles/settings.scss  ($body-font-family) — plus the
 *                                              @fontsource/* dependency in
 *                                              package.json and the matching
 *                                              entry in vite.config.mts's Fonts
 *                                              plugin. All three must agree or
 *                                              the app silently falls back to
 *                                              system sans-serif.
 *     Editing them HERE does nothing on its own. To change the look, re-run
 *     `/new-project` (or ask Claude to "apply the brand preset") — the skill
 *     propagates these into the two control-panel files and keeps them in sync.
 *     They live here so the choices are inspectable and a future project can
 *     start from this preset instead of re-answering the quiz.
